1, One canister can store up to 48GB of data! Moreover this is a temporary limitation and the memory limitation is frequently uplifted. 

2, Error. We try to assign a new value to an immutable variable. Code does not compile.

3, There are two issues:
-Error. 0 is not the Type of Text. Code does not compile. 
-Furthermore a 'query' function is used to change values. That's wrong. Changes will not persist. In order to make changes we need to remove the 'query' keyword.

4, False. If we remove the async keyword of the return argument the code does not compile (even if it is a query function).
